# Exercise 11: Use UI frameworks like Chakra UI

## Background
In [Exercise 09](../exercise-09--create-custom-style) we learned how to create and use CSS files. But, most of the developers use UI frameworks to make their life easier. Using a UI framework like Chakra UI in combination with Next.js will supercharge your feature development and make the styling of your app even easier.

Frameworks like [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) utilize the React Context API to configure your web app's theme and ensure consistent styles. As we mentioned in the [Exercise 07](../exercise-07--override-the-app-component), we can override the `App` component to persist layout between page changes and inject additional data into pages. That's where we can add the `ChakraProvider`. Chakra UI also comes with a `ColorModeScript` specifically built for Next.js that we need to put in our custom `Document`, which we learned how to override in [Exercise 08](../exercise-08--override-the-document).

## üöÄ Exercise
Configure Chakra UI in your project.

## üö© Checkpoint
This exercise marks the third checkpoint at which we'll go into breakout rooms to do the following exercises:
- [Exercise 07: Override the App Component](../exercise-07--override-the-app-component)
- [Exercise 08: Override the Document](../exercise-08--override-the-document)
- [Exercise 09: Create custom style](../exercise-09--create-custom-style)
- [Exercise 10: Create custom layout](../exercise-10--create-custom-layouts)
- [Exercise 11: Use UI frameworks like Chakra UI](../exercise-11--use-ui-frameworks-like-chakra-ui)

Start with the first exercise, and work your way through the last one. If you're stuck, do not hesitate to ask. As soon as you're done you can fill out either the [Post-Breakout Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda0BFV57OWbSkshNC_jZ809HEBOuW_MzLEz1Bq4PVKtI7R9w/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.651170566=Group+3:+App+Component,+Document+Component,+Custom+Style,+Custom+Layouts,+Chakra+UI), or the feedback forms for each individual exercise. I would appreciate your feedback a lot.

## üç© Exercise Feedback form
